        <h3>Junior PHP Developer</h3>
        <p>We are looking for a junior php developer to join a team that is focused on building the services that will give our editors, developers, partners, and users the tools they need to create and benefit from a more collaborative and distributed publishing organization. The junior developer will spend his or her time writing the code (php) that will form the foundation of this world class publishing platform. While this is an entry level spot our junior dev can write well structured, object-oriented php and should be familiar with the principles of RESTful web services (you don't need to be Roy Fielding, but it would be great if you know who he is). The JD should also be comfortable developing and documenting APIs for both internal and external developer consumption. Curiosity, eagerness to learn, and the ability to understand and transform complex concepts into clean object-oriented code are extremely important. </p>
