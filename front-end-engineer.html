    <p>We look for thinking developers. We look for thinking, smiling, developers. We look for thinking, smiling developers who enjoy drinking wine. <strong>We look for thinking, smiling developers who enjoy drinking wine and thinking about how we can use code to manipulate the data surrounding that wine in novel and useful ways.</strong></p>

    <h3>What we offer...</h3>
    <p>Aside from your run of the mill benefits package we offer developers the space to grow, experiment, learn, influence, and innovate. We provide a unique situation that combines the creative potential of an early stage start-up with the security and sway of a decades old, niche dominant publishing company.
